# milo
Milo a.k.a Modified Kilo, is a CLI text editor based on Jeremy Ruten's rendition of antirez's kilo text editor, with more syntax highlighting rules ported from bric, which is also another derivative of kilo.

This project serves as an exercise for me in learning more about C, as well as the use of git.

To compile, all you need to do is run
```
$ make
```
